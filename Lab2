In this exercise you will need to create a calculator.

Requirements:
The application should take 2 numbers, and support 4
operations (+, / , x , -) .
You need to press the equals button to get the result
displayed, and reset to clear it.
Lab #2 - Calculator

1. List the requirements, in this case you have a total of 4
requirements :

2. Sketch the application, so that you are sure about the correct
functioning.
3. You may use a flow diagram to help.
4. Use a tool of your choice, like Figma, to design the application.
5. Use the prototype ability and test it.
a) Get data (two numbers)
b) Choose an operator
c) Get the result
d) Reset the screen

Develop the application. Start from GIT - it is good practice to do
things in a standard way.
• Create a repository
• Clone the repository locally
• Create a branch for each feature

NOTE: Do not use the eval() function - it is a security
risk and bypasses custom logic. -->
