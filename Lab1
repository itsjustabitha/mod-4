Create a Figma prototype for a social media application, where you
can post your content and posts from other users are visible. Don’t
just jump into Figma, try to follow the design procedure by first
clarifying the requirements, understanding the application flow, and
sketching a quick paper mockup.
Also, this could be part of your portfolio, so try to do some research
and come up with a personal design. For example, it could be a
social media application dedicated to the Warhammer Community,
or the Ferrari Lovers. -->
